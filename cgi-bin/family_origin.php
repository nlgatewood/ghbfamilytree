	A 'surname' in today's terms is simply a personal name that is passed from either or both parents to their offspring. However, customs on the surname format and inheritance change from region to region and from time period to time period. For example, in Western nations, surnames usually occur at the end of a personal name while some East Asian countries place their surnames before given names. While almost everyone in the Western world today has a surname, before the Norman conquest of Britain in 1066 most people in Britain did not have hereditary surnames. Populations were small, making each person identifiable by personal names or nicknames. However, as the populations grew, distinguishing between different people with similar or identical names became a necessity. At first, simple identifiers like 'William of Sutton' or 'John the Tall' were used as pseudo-surnames to help keep everybody straight. At this time, surnames were rarely maintained through hereditary. It was not uncommon for people to drop or change their surname at will. Eventually, surnames begin to stick and began being passed down through the generations. In most regions and time periods, surnames were assumed from the male ancestor. However, this has not always been cut and dry. There are cases where children assumed surnames through a female ancestor. Use of the mother's name is usually due to an abnormal situation such as illegitimacy, posthumous birth, or inheritance. Some regions and cultures actually encourage the use of the mother's surname. Many Spanish-speaking cultures will combine both the mother's and the father's surname to create a dual surname. Once surnames became hereditary, they began taking on more meaningful connotations.

There are several different ways of classifying surnames. However, there are 3 major classifications: locative, occupational, and descriptive. The oldest and most common type of surname is the locative, or topographical, surname. These surnames are derived from a place or a landscape. Many were derived from their family farm or hamlet. Other common sources include a local county, local town (London, Aston), or a local landscape feature (Ford, Hill, Boroughs). The second class of surnames are the occupational surnames, or a surname derived from a trade. Occupational names tend to differ in frequency between different geographical regions. The geography of a region may favor one or more specific industries over another. For example, due to the abundance of the smithing trades, the surname 'Smith' is the most common surname in England. Another common occupational surname is 'Taylor', derived from the tailoring trades. Some other examples of occupational surnames are 'Cook' and 'Brewer'. The third, and least common, class of surnames are the descriptive surnames. These surnames are derived from a nickname, or possibly an unflattering characteristic, that was given to a person, family, or a group of people. For example, somebody who is considered to be sly or sneaky may have adopted the surname 'Fox'. The surname 'Puttock' is an old world referring to someone who is greedy. The surname 'White' or 'Red' may refer to the hair color or complexion of the person or family. However, not all descriptive surnames are necessarily unflattering. Other descriptive surnames are derived from personal or moral character, like 'Good', 'Joly', 'Kennard' (Blake, 2011).

While tracing back one's ancestry and surname can be fun and rewarding, determining the origin of a surname may be extremely difficult, if not nearly impossible. There are 45,000 different surnames in England alone and each of those names come with it's own unique history. Surnames can be derived from an almost uncountable number of things, including counties, occupations, nicknames, location, and even objects. One major obstacle in researching family ancestry is the lack of proper record keeping. While record keeping has always been important in a society (mainly for tax collection), it has not always been uniform. Even if records were taken there is no guarantee that it has survived through time. Due to war, natural disaster, or just plain mis-management, records are lost. A lot of genealogy research comprises of finding bits and pieces of records and piecing everything together. Another obstacle is a family's surname isn't what it used to be. Languages evolve and words lose, or gain, meaning. A culture/economy may evolve, moving some surnames out of favor. Due to legal reason, immigration, or on a whim many individuals and families may have changed their name's spelling, or their surname entirely. There are several factors that make studying surnames difficult. While studying them is vital to proper family history research, it's all too easy to place excessive emphasis on it.

The surname “Gatewood” is a fairly uncommon name with an uncertain origin. It seems to have originated in England. Other than its country of origin, little else is known. There are several different variations and spellings of the surname, including “Gateward”, “Gatward”, and “Gatwood”. Earliest records mention a man named William Richard le Gatward, born 1255 in County Essex. Another man named Walter Gatward was documented in 1524 in the County of Surrey (Reaney et al., 1958).  It’s likely that ‘Gatewood’ is a recent variant of a related surname.  It’s not certain when the it may have arose, but it began appearing during the mid-1600s in the records that have been reviewed so far (however, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence).   The meaning and origin of the surname Gatewood and it’s variants are still uncertain.  The most likely scenario is that they are probably occupational in origin.  They are thought to have originated from the Middle English word gate-werde (Old English gatweard) meaning “goat herd”; referring to one who herds goats.  It could also be an occupational name for a gate keeper, derived from the Middle English name gateward (Old English geatweard) (Hanks et al., 2016).  While one might instantly jump to a gatekeeper of a castle, it could simply refer to an official at a monastery, a church, or a hall.  While it's probably occupational, some sources state it may be locative. There are several locations in England with the “Gatewood” name, including Gate Wood End, South Yorkshire, Gatewood Hill, Hampshire, and Gatewood House Farm, Leicestershire. There are several ideas on what kind of place the name may have originated from. One idea is the name originated from the Old English word Gatadu, meaning '”wood where goats are kept”.  Another idea is the name originated from a compound of Old Norse Gata and Old English Wudu, meaning “wood by the road”. It could also have originated from the Old English word Geatwudu meaning, “wood with or by the gate”.

While the exact origin of the surname ‘Gatewood’ is more circumstantial than concrete, most of the evidence found points towards the later English generations residing in the county of Cambridgeshire just North of London.  The earliest record found was a birth/christening record belonging to a Henry Gatwood.  It was stated he was born in Coton, Cambridgeshire, England to Thomas and Annis Gatward in 1611 (England births and Christenings 1538-1975: Henry Gatewood).  One family records search did give Thomas Gatwood’s birth year at 1586; however, that date could not be verified.  His birthdate is believed to be on Henry’s birth record, but the record is on microfilm and not viewable through the record search engines.  There are additional resources that point towards Gatewoods residing in the Cambridgeshire region.  Henry’s son, John Gatewood, is listed as being born in Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire, England in 1654 on his birth/christening record.  The record found states John was Christened in London, but several secondary/tertiary resources have him being born in Great Shelford (England births and Christenings 1538-1975: John Gatewood).  The definitive proof may reside on his birth and christening record, which resides on microfilm, and would need to be viewed.  While this particular Gatewood lineage appears to be from the Cambridgeshire county area, several records come across show Gatwood, Gatewoods, and Gatwards appearing all across central England (Hertfordshire, Norfolk, Essex, etc).  It is not yet clear what relation they may have to one another.

		<h3 align='left'>Gatewood in the Americas</h3>
		<p>
In order to understand how Gatewoods came to be located in the Americas, it's important to know some of the history of the time. In the 17th century, England was plagued with religious, financial scandals, and governmental clashes of some kind of another. King Charles I believed in the divine right of the kings and quickly worked to consolidate power after he took the throne in 1625. He attempted to impose several religious reforms, including anti-Calvinist policies and insisting that the liturgy be celebrated as prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer. In 1639, these policies sparked off the Bishop's War when he began imposing these policies on the Scots. Consequently, King Charles sought to raise funds to pay for the Bishop's War. In order to do that, he convened the Parliament, which came to become known as the Long Parliament (1640 – 1660). Parliament quickly began wrangling power back from King Charles. They passed an Act that forbade the dissolution of the parliament without its consent. Tensions between King Charles and parliament reached a peak when in 1642, Charles entered the House of Commons and directed Parliament to give up five members of the Commons on the grounds of high treason. Parliament was outraged and quickly seized London, forcing King Charles to flee to Hampton Court Palace. In mid-1642, both the royal forces and parliamentary forces began to arm and the English Civil War began. Ultimately, by 1948 King Charles was caught and put on trial for treason. He would later be found guilty and beheaded in January 1649 (English Civil War - Charles I., 2013).

The war and strife that plagued England in the 17th century caused many people to flee England; either voluntarily or involuntarily. Many ended up looking toward the Americas to begin a better life. One man caught up in the migration to the Americas was <a href='/?pg=profile&mid=1160'>John Gatewood</a>. He first appeared in Old Rappahannock county, Virginia as a constable in 1656; where several documents have him witnessing several land grant and exchanges.  After few generations, the Gatewood families began to move Westward.  They can eventually be found again in Missouri.  From there, some trekked further West all the way to California and Washington; while others found themselves in Texas where many of their descendants reside today.  It is possible that some Gatewoods may have relocated to the West Indies for a short amount of time. However, that's mostly speculative in that no Gatewood wills have been found there (Gatewood, 1981).
