A 'surname' in today's terms is simply a personal name that is passed from either or both parents to their offspring.  However, customs on the surname format and inheritance change from region to region and from time period to time period.  For example, in Western nations, surnames usually occur at the end of a personal name while some East Asian countries place their surnames before given names.  While almost everyone in the Western world today has a surname, before the Norman conquest of Britain in 1066 most people in Britain did not have hereditary surnames.  Populations were small, making each person identifiable by personal names or nicknames.  However, as the populations grew, distinguishing between different people with similar or identical names became a necessity.  At first, simple identifiers like 'William of Sutton' or 'John the Tall' were used as pseudo-surnames to help keep everybody straight.  At this time, surnames were rarely maintained through hereditary.  It was not uncommon for people to drop or change their surname at will.  Eventually, surnames begin to stick and began being passed down through the generations.  In most regions and time periods, surnames were assumed from the male ancestor.  However, this has not always been cut and dry.  There are cases where children assumed surnames through a female ancestor.  Use of the mother's name is usually due to an abnormal situation such as illegitimacy, posthumous birth, or inheritance.  Some regions and cultures actually encourage the use of the mother's surname.  Many Spanish-speaking cultures will combine both the mother's and the father's surname to create a dual surname.  Once surnames became hereditary, they began taking on more meaningful connotations.

There are several different ways of classifying surnames.  However, there are 3 major classifications: locative, occupational, and descriptive.  The oldest and most common type of surname is the locative, or topographical, surname.  These surnames are derived from a place or a landscape.  Many were derived from their family farm or hamlet. Other common sources include a local county, local town (London, Aston), or a local landscape feature (Ford, Hill, Boroughs).  The second class of surnames are the occupational surnames, or a surname derived from a trade.  Occupational names tend to differ in frequency between different geographical regions. The geography of a region may favor one or more specific industries over another.  For example, due to the abundance of the smithing trades, the surname 'Smith' is the most common surname in England.  Another common occupational surname is 'Taylor', derived from the tailoring trades.  Some other examples of occupational surnames are 'Cook' and 'Brewer'.  The third, and least common, class of surnames are the descriptive surnames. These surnames are derived from a nickname, or possibly an unflattering characteristic, that was given to a person, family, or a group of people.  For example, somebody who is considered to be sly or sneaky may have adopted the surname 'Fox'.  The surname 'Puttock' is an old world referring to someone who is greedy.  The surname 'White' or 'Red' may refer to the hair color or complexion of the person or family.  However, not all descriptive surnames are necessarily unflattering.  Other descriptive surnames are derived from personal or moral character,  like 'Good', 'Joly', 'Kennard' (royal-brave).

While tracing back one's ancestry and surname can be fun and rewarding, determining the origin of a surname may be extremely difficult, if not nearly impossible. There are 45,000 different surnames in England alone and each of those names come with it's own unique history.  Surnames can be derived from an almost uncountable number of things, including counties, occupations, nicknames, location, and even objects.  One major obstacle in researching family ancestry is the lack of proper record keeping.  While record keeping has always been important in a society (mainly for tax collection), it has not always been uniform.  Even if records were taken there is no guarantee that it has survived through time.  Due to war, natural disaster, or just plain mis-management, records are lost.  A lot of genealogy research comprises of finding bits and pieces of records and piecing everything together.  Another obstacle is a family's surname isn't what it used to be.  Languages evolve and words lose, or gain, meaning.  A culture/economy may evolve, moving some surnames out of favor. Due to legal reason, immigration, or on a whim many individuals and families may have changed their name's spelling, or their surname entirely. There are several factors that make studying surnames difficult. While studying them is vital to proper family history research, it's all too easy to place excessive emphasis on it.

<h3 align='left'>Gatewood Surname Origin</h3>
<p>The surname “Gatewood” is a fairly uncommon name with an uncertain origin.  It probably originated in modern-day Britain.  Other than originating in Britain, little is known about its origin.  There are several different variations and spellings of the surname, including “Gateward”, “Gatward”, and “Gatwood”.  Earliest records mention a man named William Richard le Gatward, burn 1255 in County Essex.  Another man named Walter Gatward was documented in 1524 in the County of Surrey.  A man named James Gatward and Mary Rudling were married at St. George's, Hanover Square, London in 1778.  The surname “Gatewood” is commonly thought to be locative.  There are several locations in England with the “Gatewood” name, including Gate Wood End, South Yorkshire, Gatewood Hill, Hampshire, and Gatewood House Farm, Leicestershire.  There are several ideas on what kind of place the name may have originated from.  One idea is the name originated from the Old English word 'Gatadu', meaning '”wood where goats are kept”.  Another idea is the name originated from a compound of Old Norse 'Gata' and Old English 'Wudu', meaning “wood by the road”.  It could also have originated from the Old English word 'Geatwudu' meaning, “wood with or by the gate”.  While most evidence points to a locative origin, many sources claim it may also be occupational.  One idea is the name originated from the Old English word 'GeatWeard' meaning “Gate Keeper”.  This may refer to being a keeper of the gate; either an official at a monastery, a church, or a hall.  However, 'GeatWeard' could also mean “Goat-ward” or “Goat-Keeper”, which may hint to a goat-hearding profession.<p>
