<p>Before the Norman conquest of Britain in 1066, most people in Britain did not have hereditary surnames. Populations were small, making each person identifiable by personal names or nicknames. However, as the populations grew, distinguishing between different people with similar or identical names became a necessity. At first, simple identifiers like 'William of Sutton' or 'John the Tall' were used as pseudo-surnames to help keep everybody straight. At this time, surnames were rarely maintained through hereditary. It was not uncommon for people to drop or change their surname at will. Eventually, surnames begin to stick and began being passed down through the generations. Once surnames became hereditary, they began taking on more meaningful connotations.</p>

<p>The oldest and most common type of surname is the locative surname, or a surname derived from a place. Many locative surnames were taken from their family farm or hamlet. Other sources include a local county, local town, or a local landscape feature. Some common examples of locative surnames include 'Hill', 'Hampshire', and 'Boroughs'. Another common type of surname is the occupational surname, or a surname derived from a trade. Some examples of occupational surnames are 'Smith', 'Taylor', 'Cook', and 'Brewer'. Occupational names tend to differ in frequency between different geographical regions. The geography of a region may favor one or more specific industries over another. Another common type of surname is the nickname surname. These surnames are derived from a nickname that was given to a person, family, or a group of people. Names like 'Fox', derived from the crafty animal, or 'White', perhaps referring to the hair color or complexion, is common. Other nickname surnames are derived from personal or moral character, for example 'Good', 'Joly', 'Kennard' (royal-brave), or ‘Puttock’ (greedy).</p>

<p>Determining the origin of a surname may be extremely difficult, if not nearly impossible. There are 45,000 different surnames in England alone and each of those names come with it's own unique history. Surnames can be derived from an almost uncountable number of things, including counties, occupations, nicknames, location, and even objects. Languages evolve and words lose, or gain, meaning. A culture/economy may evolve, moving some surnames out of favor. Due to legal reason, immigration, or on a whim many individuals and families may have changed their name's spelling, or their surname entirely. Due to war, natural disaster, or just plain mis-management, records are lost. There are several factors that make studying surnames difficult. While studying them is vital to proper family history research, it's all too easy to place excessive emphasis on it.</p>  

<p>The surname “Gatewood” is a fairly uncommon name with an uncertain origin.  It probably originated in modern-day Britain.  Other than originating in Britain, little is known about its origin.  There are several different variations and spellings of the surname, including “Gateward”, “Gatward”, and “Gatwood”.  Earliest records mention a man named William Richard le Gatward, burn 1255 in County Essex.  Another man named Walter Gatward was documented in 1524 in the County of Surrey.  A man named James Gatward and Mary Rudling were married at St. George's, Hanover Square, London in 1778.  The surname “Gatewood” is commonly thought to be locative.  There are several locations in England with the “Gatewood” name, including Gate Wood End, South Yorkshire, Gatewood Hill, Hampshire, and Gatewood House Farm, Leicestershire.  There are several ideas on what kind of place the name may have originated from.  One idea is the name originated from the Old English word 'Gatadu', meaning '”wood where goats are kept”.  Another idea is the name originated from a compound of Old Norse 'Gata' and Old English 'Wudu', meaning “wood by the road”.  It could also have originated from the Old English word 'Geatwudu' meaning, “wood with or by the gate”.  While most evidence points to a locative origin, many sources claim it may also be occupational.  One idea is the name originated from the Old English word 'GeatWeard' meaning “Gate Keeper”.  This may refer to being a keeper of the gate; either an official at a monastery, a church, or a hall.  However, 'GeatWeard' could also mean “Goat-ward” or “Goat-Keeper”, which may hint to a goat-hearding profession.<p>
